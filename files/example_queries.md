#### Lesson Outline:
1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Begin with a brief review of fractions. Ask students what they know about fractions and their parts (numerator and denominator).
   - Introduce the objective: Comparing fractions with different denominators.
   - Show examples of comparing fractions using visual models.
2. **Direct Instruction (20 minutes)**
   - Explain how to compare fractions by:
     - Finding a common denominator
     - Using visual models to compare sizes (less than, greater than, equal)
   - Demonstrate using a fraction circle: Show 1/2 and 1/4. Ask students which is larger and why, using the model to support their answer.
   - Use the number line to show 1/3 and 1/4. Have students identify their positions and decide which is greater.
3. **Guided Practice (15 minutes)**
   - Distribute the worksheet (attached) with fraction comparison problems.
   - Work through the first few problems as a class. Encourage students to use visual aids.
   - Circulate around the classroom to support students and answer questions.
4. **Independent Practice (10 minutes)**
   - Allow students to complete the remainder of the worksheet independently. 
5. **Closure (5 minutes)**
   - Review the answers as a class and discuss any challenges faced during the worksheet.
   - Reinforce the concept of comparing fractions and the methods used.
#### Assessment:
- **Worksheet**: To assess understanding of comparing fractions.
- **Exit Slip**: A short exit slip with one question: "Which fraction is greater: 2/3 or 3/5? Explain why."
#### Worksheet: Comparing Fractions
1. Compare the fractions. Write <, >, or =:
   - a) 1/2 __ 3/4
   - b) 2/5 __ 1/3
   - c) 4/6 __ 2/3
2. Use the number line below to place and compare the following fractions: 1/4 and 1/2.
   - [Draw a number line from 0 to 1]
3. Choose two fractions from the following list and explain which one is larger and why:
   - 3/8, 1/2
#### Exit Slip
**Name: ___________________________**
1. Compare the fractions: 2/3 __ 3/5. Explain your reasoning:  _________________________________________________________  
#### Special Considerations:
- This lesson involves visual aids and hands-on activities which require supervision. Ensure that students are appropriately supported during group work and individual practice.
- Check with district policy in case technology is used in future extensions (e.g., online fraction games).
- Ensure accessibility for all students who may need special accommodations.

#### Lesson Plan: Understanding Place Value (2.NBT.2)
#### Grade Level: 2nd Grade  
#### Subject: Mathematics  
#### Duration: 60 minutes  
#### Learning Objective:
Students will understand and demonstrate the concept of place value by identifying the place value of two-digit numbers and composing/decomposing numbers.
#### Materials Needed:
- Base-ten blocks
- Place value chart 
- Whiteboard and markers
- Colored pencils or markers
- Worksheets for practice
- Digital tools (e.g., an interactive whiteboard or a tablet with a math app that focuses on place value)
#### Lesson Outline:
#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Hook**: Share a story or visual of where we see numbers in the real world (e.g., house numbers, prices).
- **Discussion**: Briefly explain place value using examples in two-digit numbers (e.g., the number 36 means 3 tens and 6 ones).
#### 2. Direct Instruction (15 minutes)
- Use **visual aids**: Introduce a place value chart on the board. 
- Demonstrate **hands-on learning** using base-ten blocks; show how two-digit numbers can be represented.
  - For example, for the number 45, compose 4 tens and 5 ones using blocks.
#### 3. Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- **Small Group Activity**: 
  - Split students into pairs and give each pair base-ten blocks and a place value chart.
  - Assign various two-digit numbers. Have them use the blocks to compose the numbers.
  - Encourage them to articulate what each digit represents.
#### 4. Independent Practice (15 minutes)
- **Worksheet Activity**: Hand out worksheets with two-digit numbers and a mix of tasks: 
  - Identify place values
  - Draw the number using base blocks
  - Compose/decompose numbers (e.g., break down 56 into 5 tens and 6 ones).
- **Digital Option**: Allow students to work on tablets using math apps focusing on place value concepts.
#### 5. Conclusion and Review (5 minutes)
- Review key concepts with a brief class discussion.
- Ask students to share one new thing they learned about place value today.
#### Differentiation Strategies for Learning Styles:
- **Visual Learners**: Use charts, drawings, and physical blocks.
- **Auditory Learners**: Encourage discussion and explanation of numbers in pairs.
- **Kinesthetic Learners**: Manipulating the base-ten blocks will enhance understanding.
- **Reading/Writing Learners**: Worksheets and writing about what they learned will cater to their style. 
#### Assessment:
- Observe students during group activity to assess understanding.
- Collect worksheets to evaluate individual comprehension of place value.
#### Special Considerations:
- If using digital tools, ensure supervision for online safety and that necessary permissions and accounts are established. 
- If certain students require specific accommodations, ensure tools and activities are inclusive and accessible for all learners.
This lesson plan offers diverse methods to cater to different learning styles and ensures that all students can engage with the concept of place value effectively.

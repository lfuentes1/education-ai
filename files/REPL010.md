#### Lesson Plan: Understanding and Comparing Fractions (4.NF.2)
**Grade Level:** 4  
**Subject:** Mathematics  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Standards:** 4.NF.2 - Compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators.
#### Lesson Objectives:
- Students will understand how to compare two fractions with different numerators and denominators.
- Students will use visual models and number lines to demonstrate their understanding of fraction comparison.
#### Materials Needed:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Visual fraction models (fraction circles, bars)
- Number lines
- Worksheets for practice
- Exit slips
#### Lesson Outline:
1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Begin with a brief review of fractions. Ask students what they know about fractions and their parts (numerator and denominator).
   - Introduce the objective: Comparing fractions with different denominators.
   - Show examples of comparing fractions using visual models.
2. **Direct Instruction (20 minutes)**
   - Explain how to compare fractions by:
     - Finding a common denominator
     - Using visual models to compare sizes (less than, greater than, equal)
   - Demonstrate using a fraction circle: Show 1/2 and 1/4. Ask students which is larger and why, using the model to support their answer.
   - Use the number line to show 1/3 and 1/4. Have students identify their positions and decide which is greater.
3. **Guided Practice (15 minutes)**
   - Distribute the worksheet (attached) with fraction comparison problems.
   - Work through the first few problems as a class. Encourage students to use visual aids.
   - Circulate around the classroom to support students and answer questions.
4. **Independent Practice (10 minutes)**
   - Allow students to complete the remainder of the worksheet independently. 
5. **Closure (5 minutes)**
   - Review the answers as a class and discuss any challenges faced during the worksheet.
   - Reinforce the concept of comparing fractions and the methods used.
#### Assessment:
- **Worksheet**: To assess understanding of comparing fractions.
- **Exit Slip**: A short exit slip with one question: "Which fraction is greater: 2/3 or 3/5? Explain why."
#### Worksheet: Comparing Fractions
1. Compare the fractions. Write <, >, or =:
   - a) 1/2 __ 3/4
   - b) 2/5 __ 1/3
   - c) 4/6 __ 2/3
2. Use the number line below to place and compare the following fractions: 1/4 and 1/2.
   - [Draw a number line from 0 to 1]
3. Choose two fractions from the following list and explain which one is larger and why:
   - 3/8, 1/2
#### Exit Slip
**Name: ___________________________**
1. Compare the fractions: 2/3 __ 3/5. Explain your reasoning:  _________________________________________________________  
#### Special Considerations:
- This lesson involves visual aids and hands-on activities which require supervision. Ensure that students are appropriately supported during group work and individual practice.
- Check with district policy in case technology is used in future extensions (e.g., online fraction games).
- Ensure accessibility for all students who may need special accommodations.

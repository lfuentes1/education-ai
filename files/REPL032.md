####Lesson Plan: Understanding Place Value (TEKS Standard 3.D)

**Grade Level**: 2nd Grade  
**Subject**: Mathematics  
**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**TEKS Standard**: 3.D - The student understands the place value system. The student is expected to: (A) recognize that the digits in a three-digit number represent amounts of hundreds, tens, and ones; and (B) compare and order three-digit numbers.

#### Objective
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify the values of digits in three-digit numbers (hundreds, tens, and ones).
2. Compare and order three-digit numbers using symbols (<, >, =).

#### Materials Needed
- Base ten blocks (hundreds, tens, ones)
- Place value charts
- Whiteboard and markers
- Number cards (with three-digit numbers)
- Worksheets for practice
- Interactive digital tools (if applicable)

#### Lesson Outline

**Introduction (15 minutes)**
1. Begin the lesson with a quick review of two-digit numbers and their place values.
2. Introduce three-digit numbers by writing a number (e.g., 254) on the board.
3. Discuss what each digit represents: hundreds, tens, and ones. Use base ten blocks to visualize.
4. Engage the students by asking, "What would happen if we had a '2' in the hundreds place?"

**Guided Practice (30 minutes)**
1. Distribute place value charts to each student.
2. Create a few three-digit numbers with the class. For example, ask students to tell you what number is formed with hundreds, tens, and ones using base ten blocks.
3. Have students practice identifying the place value of numbers displayed on the board.
4. Group activity: Pair students up and give each pair a set of number cards. Instruct them to create three-digit numbers and discuss the values of each digit.

**Independent Practice (20 minutes)**
1. Hand out worksheets with exercises that require students to:
   - Identify the place value of digits in given three-digit numbers.
   - Compare three-digit numbers (using <, >, =).
   - Order a set of three-digit numbers from least to greatest.
   
**Conclusion (15 minutes)**
1. Gather students to review the correct answers from the worksheets.
2. Encourage students to explain how they found the values and made comparisons.
3. Ask some students to share their number creations from the group activity.

**Assessment**
- Monitor student participation and understanding during guided and independent practice.
- Review completed worksheets to assess understanding and provide feedback.

**Extensions**
- For advanced learners, introduce them to larger numbers (four-digit) using the same concepts.
- Provide additional challenges on comparing numbers that are close in value (e.g., 245 vs. 254).

**Special Considerations**
- If using digital tools during the lesson, ensure students have access and account requirements are met (supervision may be needed).
- Check for any potential financial contribution required for materials (if students need to take items home).

This structure allows flexibility in teaching while ensuring that all students are engaged and learning effectively.
